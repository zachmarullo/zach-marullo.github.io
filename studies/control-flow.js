/**
 * Control Flow: The order in which the computer executes statements in a script. 
 * Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the
 *  (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops.
 * 
 * 
 * Block Statements:
 * The most basic statements in a script, which is used to group statements. The block is denoted by a pair of curly braces.
 * These statements are commonly used with control flow statements, such as an if, for, or while loop.

//Example 1:(if conditional)
if (1 === 1) { /// 1 === 1 resolves to "true" so "This prints" is logged to the console.
    console.log ("This prints");
};
//Example 2: (for loop)
let arr = [1, 2, 3];
for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
//       ^ this statement sets a counting variable equal to some number to start the loop
//                     ^ middle statement tells the loop how long to keep looping for
//                                 ^statement increments the counting variable in order to keep a loop from running endlessly
    console.log(arr[i]); // prints each iteration's value

 * multiple conditional statements can be chained in an if-else statement-chain

/**
 * Another way to use control flow is a switch statement.
 * A switch statement allows a program to evaluate an expression and attempt to match the expression's
